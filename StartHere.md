Coding is fun!
Stressing about it can make it feel hard. Tying it to a "getting a job" can make if feel harder still. Wrapping it around "I want to get a job at one of FAANG" can make it feel harder (and intimidating) still! Relax. Focus on the fun part, add some structure, throw in discipline and keep an eye on where you want to go - and enjoy the scenery along the way, trusting you will get there (unless you happen to discover a better destination along the way... but that's an entirely different story!) :) 

Structure of learning to code:

1. Pick a language: Either Java or Python are good choices (eventually you would want to learn both). You would want to learn the basics of the language, and many resources are available for free to get started. Plan on learning basic aspects and experiment with various aspects (try codingbat.com to experiment). 

2. Learn about Data Structures (DS): These are a means of holding data in storage/memory, purpose-suited to the task at hand (eg - your familiarity with arrays over linked list might bias you to use an array when your use case calls for a dynamically sized list, but it might not be the optimal choice). Implement these data structures from scratch in your language of choice. This will strengthen your understanding of data structures. This is also where you would start to experiment with teh notion of the Big-Oh (O) notations, which are a way of discussing performance / efficiency of performing an operation on a DS. 

3. Learn basic Algorithms: For searching, sorting etc. Again, many resources are available online, and we will talk about those. When working on algorithms, you get to further hone and master your understanding and evaluation of Big-Oh notations, which are critical in evaluating and benchmarking algorithms. 

4. Practice Coding: Now to even more fun part - problem solving!Use resources such as LeetCode.com etc to work on 1 to 3 coding problems daily!! Daily is important :) And, you would also want to scout the web (or GitHub) for good code samples to read - again daily! If you have made it this far, it is only a matter of time the mechanics and fear of coding will give way to what you can actually do with coding! Kind of like, when learning to drive, all of one's attention is on the brake, gear, steering, etc, but once one has mastered driving, the question is about"Where to?" :) 


As with anything, two things are critical to learning: 

1. Know your goal and motivation (if this is weak, you are unlikely to stay the course)

2. Stay the course - consistency and persistence are way more important strength builders than sporadic high effort (think of the hare versus tortoise story)
